# JS

This folder will store all the javascript files that are specific to the project.
Here's some rules to follow in order to all work the same way across projects.

1. Only specific project files
   - If a part of the code can be used in multiple projects, think about making a sharable package
2. Stick to standards
   - **Avoid using coffeescript**, unless necessary
   - Use **Yarn/NPM** as package manager
   - Use `import` syntax to include packages
   - Process your files to **ES5** spec in `dist` folder
   - Use **webpack** when needed to package your codebase
3. Syntax
   - Use **meaningful variables names**
   - Prefer understandable statements over too complex ones just to prove your IQ
4. Document your code!
   - Use the docblock syntax to document your code
5. Don't be a jerk
   - Your work in team, so don't do crap on your own
   - Document your code when needed!!!
   - Stick to standards is a good way to start...
