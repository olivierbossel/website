/**
 * The purpose of a color schema is to basically set the color text of all his children.
 * This is useful when for example the background is dark and you need the content on top
 * to be light like white or whatever.
 * It's usually a good idea to start with at least 1 color schema that is the opposite of
 * your default site color. If your website is dark with light text by default, think to
 * create a `.cs-dark` color schema and vice versa...
